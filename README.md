Quantum Entanglement: “Spooky Action at a Distance”

Quantum technology and research is opening the door to all kinds of new opportunities and possibilities. One of those possibilities involves the speed of communications, prompting experts to consider whether quantum communication is faster than the speed of light. Read a simple breakdown of how quantum communication works here.

The prospect of faster-than-light (FTL) communications revolves around quantum entanglement, a phenomenon Einstein described as “spooky action at a distance”. The idea is that entanglement implies instant communication. However, even though entangled quantum particles seem to interact with each other instantaneously -regardless of the distance, breaking the speed of light – with our current understanding of quantum mechanics, it is impossible to send data using quantum entanglement. That’s the key: the inability to send data or information. In order to “communicate,” you need to be able to send data.

Quantum entanglement is a complex phenomenon, but perhaps the simplest explanation, courtesy of Astronomy Magazine, is that quantum entanglement occurs “when two particles are inextricably linked together no matter their separation from one another. Although these entangled particles are not physically connected, they still are able to share information with each other instantaneously — seemingly breaking one of the most hard-and-fast rules of physics: that no information can be transmitted faster than the speed of light.” This the basis for the premise that quantum entanglement can enable communications faster than the speed of light. Unfortunately, it’s not so simple.

Forbes addresses the prospect of the speed of quantum communications in an article that explains in greater detail why quantum entanglement can’t enable communications faster than the speed of light. In it, Chad Orzel proposes several scenarios where entanglement could potentially allow FTL communication, but in each case he finds a reason why it won’t work. Ultimately, you can’t force an entangled particle into a particular state and you can’t force a measurement to produce a particular outcome because the results of quantum measurement are random. Even with measurements that are perfectly correlated, no information passes between them. The sender and receiver can only see the correlation when they get back together and compare measurements, which they have to do that at or below the speed of light. No real information is passed when the entangled particles affect each other.

When we conquer communication through quantum entanglement, faster-than-light communications will become a real possibility.

We transferred information over a one-meter cable without sending any photons to do this, a pretty spooky and unusual achievement.” — Prof. Andrew Cleland

### Ghostly quantum communication


Entangled photons and phonons defy intuition: these particles can be quantum-mechanically entangled, an entanglement that can survive over large distances. A change in one particle then spookily elicits a change in the other. Quantum communication takes advantage of this phenomenon by encoding information in the particles.

Cleland wanted to find a method to send quantum information without losing it in the transmission. He and his team, including PME graduate student Hung-Shen Chang, developed a system that entangled two communication nodes using microwave photons—the same photons used in your cell phone—through a microwave cable. For this experiment, they used a microwave cable about a meter in length. By turning the system on and off in a controlled manner, they were able to quantum-entangle the two nodes and send information between them—without ever having to send photons through the cable.

“We transferred information over a one-meter cable without sending any photons to do this, a pretty spooky and unusual achievement,” Cleland said. “In principle, this would also work over a much longer distance. It would be much faster and more efficient than systems that send photons through fiber-optic channels.”

Though the system has limitations—it must be kept very cold, at temperatures a few degrees above absolute zero—it could potentially work at room temperature with atoms instead of photons. But Cleland’s system provides more control, and he and his team are conducting experiments that would entangle several photons together in a more complicated state.

### Entangling phonons with the same technique
Entangled particles aren’t just limited to photons or atoms, however. In a second paper published June 12 in the journal Physical Review X, Cleland and his team entangled two phonons—the quantum particle of sound—for the first time ever.

Using a system built to communicate with phonons, similar to the photon quantum communication system, the team, including former postdoctoral fellow Audrey Bienfait, entangled two microwave phonons (which have roughly a million times higher pitch than can be heard with the human ear).

Once the phonons were entangled, the team used one of the phonons as a “herald,” which was used to affect how their quantum system used the other phonon. The herald allowed the team to perform a so-called “quantum eraser” experiment, in which information is erased from a measurement, even after the measurement has been completed.
